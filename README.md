Hello,

Welcome to Data Hive: Your Automated Data Analyst!

This project is a collaborative effort between myself (@ravemae) and my partner (@escannnor). To enhance efficiency and speed up development, we have divided the project into two parts, allowing us to handle different tasks concurrently. We aim to release the BETA version within approximately one month, with the complete project expected to be ready two months after the BETA release.

We will be leveraging several powerful Python libraries to build this application. Pandas will be our go-to tool for data manipulation and analysis, while NumPy will handle efficient numerical operations. For visualizing our data, Matplotlib will create detailed plots and charts, complemented by Seaborn for more sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing graphics. Openpyxl will facilitate our interaction with Excel files, making it easy to read, write, and modify spreadsheet data.

Incorporating advanced AI capabilities, we will use Gemini AI to generate insights and recommendations from the data, providing valuable suggestions and summaries. FastAPI will form the backbone of our application, allowing us to develop a robust and high-performance backend API. To produce comprehensive and professional reports, ReportLab will be used to generate PDFs that include analysis results and visualizations.

Throughout the development process, I will be posting updates after each commit to track our progress. Thank you for following along on this journey!

Best regards,
Vera Ezeanya, Sodiq Agboke
